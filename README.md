# CIV102-Bridge
Matboard bridge project for CIV102 - Structure and Material

For the final project of CIV102, students have to design a matboard bridge using limited materials. 

For this project, I developed the python code that models the bridge and calculates the failure load and thus the factor of safety. 

Inside the repository also includes the design report (which includes the designing and construction process), as well as the engineering drawings of the bridge.

For further information, https://civmin.utoronto.ca/bridge-testing-day-in-civ102-video/ includes the testing day of the bridge. (As of Jan 10 2023, the website only contains the testing information for 2021)
